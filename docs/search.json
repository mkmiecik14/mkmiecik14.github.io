Our question was, “Are there any summary measures, such as goals scored or save percentage, that predict playoff performance or championship wins?”…\n\n\n\n My Reads\n\n January 3, 2019 Academic R\nI absolutely love reading and collecting books. Whenever I’m in a phase where I am constantly reading, I feel more creative and confident in my academic work. However, in the busy mix of an academic semester, it’s easy to put reading off to the side in lieu of data analysis, writing, and conferences. Below is a live tracker of my reading progress (I’m trying for around 20 pages per day) to help motivate me to read every day. I’ll do my best to update this weekly…\n\n\n\n Bootstrapping and Permutation Testing: A Shiny Dashboard\n\n September 2, 2018 Academic R Shiny Dashboard\nWe upgraded our shiny app to a shiny dashboard.\n\n\n\n A Method for Characterizing Semantic and Lexical Properties of Sentence Completions in Traumatic Brain Injury\n\n July 22, 2018 Academic Paper Review\nLast summer we published a paper in Psychological Assessment that presented methods to better characterize verbal responses on neuropsychological assessments. These methods were applied to a specific cognitive test called the Hayling Sentence Completion Test. We demonstrated that these new methods provide additional insights into the cognitive performance of individuals with mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI)…\n\n\n\n Bootstrapping and Permutation Testing: A Shiny App\n\n June 7, 2018 Academic R Shiny App\nThis post serves as a brief overview of the difference between bootstrapping and permutation testing with a shiny app to visualize their differences. The example statistic we use here is a correlation; however, these techniques can be extended to a variety of statistics (e.g., t-test, ANOVA, PCA)…\n\n\n\n Simulating 2018 NCAA March Madness Tournament Performance in R\n\n March 20, 2018 Academic R\nA few of us graduate students decided it would be fun to simulate this year’s NCAA Men’s National Championship tournament using R. When we all met to discuss our method to simuluate tournament performance, we quickly realized several methods emerged…\n\n\n\n Multilevel Modeling in R with NHL Power Play Data\n\n February 11, 2018 Academic Hockey Analytics R\nThis post serves as both a tutorial on how to perform multilevel modeling in R and an analysis that provides insight to how powerplay goals in the NHL have changed across 10 years. Readers will learn how to explore data using plots, use R to fit linear models, and how to extract inferences from the results.\n\n\n\n Writing a Literature Review\n\n September 25, 2017 Academic\nI recently completed my first comprehensive literature review as part of a graduate school milestone project. Before starting, I sought guidance from online blogs and university workshops held by our library. The tips I learned from these resources were extremely helpful, but not everything worked for me. This is simply a list of things that worked/did not work for me during the reading and writing process of my literature review…\n\n\n\n Using Xbox Controllers and Sending EEG Triggers with E-Prime\n\n June 12, 2017 Academic R E-Prime EEG\nI just spent an entire week wrangling the E-Prime beast and I’ve lived to tell the tale. I was able to successfully integrate an Xbox controller to accept participant responses as well as communicate these to an EEG system as triggers. This wouldn’t have been possible without the help of benevolent bloggers and discussions on E-Prime’s Google group, so thank you all! I’ll point out these information sources along the way…\n\n\n\n ggplot2 Histogram Logo Fail\n\n May 15, 2017 Academic R\nWhen I first started creating this website (in WordPress), I thought it would be cool have have my own logo. Why not, right? I figured I’d go super nerdy and have a cool histogram plot with a density curve through it. I had just finished reading Hadley Wickham’s ggplot2 book and I was excited to put some of those newly learned skills to use…\n\n\n\n Stop Using Excel to Preprocess E-Prime Data\n\n May 15, 2017 Academic R E-Prime\nExcel is a great tool for processing data. Whether it’s calculating a quick average, standard deviation, or t-test, Excel is fast and simple to learn and use. In fact, most of my colleagues use Excel to preprocess their data from experiments programmed in E-Prime, a software tool for running psychological experiments. However, preprocessing your E-Prime data in Excel will…"

    "text": "About Me\n\nI’m a cognitive neuroscientist doing a (second) postdoc at 23andMe researching genotypic and phenotypic markers of Parkinson’s Disease. In my first postdoc, I studied how individuals’ sensitivity across multiple sensory modalities predicted their long-term pelvic pain. In graduate school, I studied volitional control of semantic processing, executive dysfunction in chronic-phase traumatic brain injury, and human reasoning. My undergraduate work utilized EEG to understand the neural correlates and timecourse of analogical reasoning. In my spare time I enjoy reading, exercising, crossword puzzles, and the endless pursuit of new hobbies.

    "text": "My infatuation (some say obsession) with hockey began during my undergrad in the city of Chicago. I was fortunate enough to see the Blackhawks win the Stanley Cup when I was in Chicago not once, but TWICE! As I have grown to appreciate and love hockey, I found another outlet to further submerse myself in the sport — statistics! A few ideas I have played around with have been the power play, face-offs, potential trends across time, and seeing if there is anything that can predict the likelihood of a Stanley Cup victory!\nDoors closing… Welcome to the Blue Line.\n\n Posts\n\n\n\n\n Chicago Blackhawks: Scoring Density Analysis for the 2018-2019 Season\n\n July 19th, 2019 Hockey Analytics R\nWe’ve all heard Wayne Gretzky’s famous quote, “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.” Historically, the Chicago Blackhawks have taken Gretzky’s advice to heart and are one of the top four most efficient offenses since 2007 (for a statistical analysis, see my previous article)…\n\n\n Chicago Blackhawks: An Efficient Offensive Machine\n\n June 27th, 2019 Hockey Analytics R\nWhen watching Game 7 of the Dallas and St. Louis playoff series this year, I received a text from a friend of mine commenting on the sheer discrepancy of shots on goal between the teams…\n\n\n Coach Q vs. Jeremy Colliton: First 67 Games As Blackhawks’ Head Coach\n\n May 15th, 2019 Hockey Analytics R\nCoach Q had become Chicago’s steadfast leader and genius architect, constructing synergistic line combinations and masterfully adapting to player matchups throughout his 3 Stanley Cup winning tenure…\n\n\n Chicago Blackhawks: analyzing Patrick Kane’s career scoring tendencies\n\n April 9th, 2019 Hockey Analytics R\nThe Chicago Blackhawks‘ own Patrick “Showtime” Kane. The breaker of records, the daddy of dangles, the lighter of lamps. No matter what you call him, Kaner has had a tremendous year and is deserving of some hardware at the end of the season…\n\n\n Chicago Blackhawks 2018-19 Player Grades: Patrick Kane\n\n April 19th, 2019 Hockey Analytics R\nPatrick Kane battled through adversity at every corner this season. His ability to take over a game, frequent double shifts (including powerplays) and his knack for finding teammates with precise passes injected hope into the bloodstream of ’Hawks fans every time he took the ice…\n\n\n\n Exploring 11 Years of Chicago Blackhawk’s Data using Principal Components Analysis\n\n March 7, 2019 Academic Hockey Analytics R\nIn this post we explore 11 seasons (2007 - 2018) of team summary data from the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). Our question was, “Are there any summary measures, such as goals scored or save percentage, that predict playoff performance or championship wins?”…\n\n\n\n Multilevel Modeling in R with NHL Power Play Data\n\n February 11, 2018 Academic Hockey Analytics R\nThis post serves as both a tutorial on how to perform multilevel modeling in R and an analysis that provides insight to how powerplay goals in the NHL have changed across 10 years. Readers will learn how to explore data using plots, use R to fit linear models, and how to extract inferences from the results.\n\n\n\n The Last Decade: NHL’s Best and Worst Power Play Teams\n\n May 15, 2017 Hockey Analytics R\nSo you are watching your favorite NHL team and they finally draw a powerplay. Awesome! The ice opens up with the missing player and it shouldn’t be too hard to score…right? As a previous water polo player, I know what it is like to endure the wrath of a furious coach after a missed man advantage opportunity. In my experience, coaches semed convinced that the man-up should lead to a goal 100% of the time. But how important is this seemingly advantageous situation in the NHL?…"
