This repo is my [personal academic website](https://mattkmiecik.com/) built entirely in R & RStudio where I blog about all things academic/data science related.

My philosophy towards science and computer programming is that it should be open, transparent, and communicable. I am thrilled to be able to share all my blog posts on Github, so that visitors to my site and repo can see how it was constructed even down to the code used to create the site!

Iâ€™ve worked really hard on my website and am passionate about showing others my code. Therefore, please consider following the guidelines imposed by MIT licenses: feel free to modify the code as long as you provide attribution back to the source (me!). I also ask those who are interested in the mechanics of my website or would like to contribute to please fork and create pull requests.

Thanks!

Matt
