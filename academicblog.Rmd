I just spent an entire week wrangling the E-Prime beast and I've lived to tell the tale. I was able to successfully integrate an Xbox controller to accept participant responses as well as communicate these to an EEG system as triggers. This wouldn't have been possible without the help of benevolent bloggers and discussions on E-Prime's Google group, so thank you all! I'll point out these information sources along the way...

Excel is a great tool for processing data. Whether it's calculating a quick average, standard deviation, or t-test, Excel is fast and simple to learn and use. In fact, most of my colleagues use Excel to preprocess their data from experiments programmed in E-Prime, a software tool for running psychological experiments. However, preprocessing your E-Prime data in Excel will...
