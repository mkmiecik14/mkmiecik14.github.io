Why not, right? I figured I'd go super nerdy and have a cool histogram plot with a density curve through it. I had just finished reading Hadley Wickham's ggplot2 [book](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book) and I was excited to put some of those newly learned skills to use. \n\nFirst off, I'm not a design guy (if you can't tell already), but I had a vision of this plot and I just went with it. After making the basic design, I couldn't figure out how to get spaces between the bars in a ggplot2 histogram. After searching everywhere, the best advice I got was, [\"Histograms don't have spaces between them, so why would you want them?\"](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ggplot2/yTEm-OfsX18)\n\nThen it dawned on me that I could plot two histograms, and then set their position to dodge and make one of the histograms invisible. So first, let's plot two histograms:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)  # Load ggplot2\n\nset.seed(14)      # Set seed for reproducible example\nsamplesA <- 400   # 400 samples in the distribution\n\n# Create dataframe for plotting\nlogoData <- \n  data.frame(dist = rep(c('A', 'B'), each = samplesA), x = rnorm(2*samplesA))\n\n# Logo plot\nggplot(logoData, aes(x, fill = dist, colour = dist)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), position = 'dodge', bins = 13) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 1/5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#1191e0', 'lightslategrey')) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('#222222', '#222222')) +\n  xlim(-4 , 4) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = 'none',\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#eaeaea')\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](post-ggplot2-Histogram-Logo-Fail_files/figure-html/two-histograms-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, let's make one of the histograms invisible by setting its fill and color to NA, giving the illusion that there is only one histogram plotted:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(logoData, aes(x, fill = dist, colour = dist)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), position = 'dodge', bins = 13) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#1191e0', NA)) +  # Setting fill to NA\n  scale_color_manual(values = c('#222222', NA)) + # Setting color to NA\n  scale_alpha_manual(values = c(0, NA)) +\n  xlim(-4 , 4) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.title = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = 'none'#,\n    #panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#eaeaea')\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](post-ggplot2-Histogram-Logo-Fail_files/figure-html/one-histogram-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we are left with a single histogram density plot with spaces between the bars. However, when I tried to make this my website logo, I couldn't figure out a way to get a high resolution image at 100 x 100 pixels. Instead, my brother made me a sweet bar graph with hockey sticks through it in Photoshop! Either way, through this journey I was able to come up with a solution to having spaces between histogram bars in ggplot2. Hopefully this is useful to someone!\n",
