My infatuation (some say obsession) with hockey began during my undergrad in the city of Chicago. I was fortunate enough to see the Blackhawks win the Stanley Cup when I was in Chicago not once, but TWICE! As I have grown to appreciate and love hockey, I found another outlet to further submerse myself in the sport — statistics!  A few ideas I have played around with have been the power play, face-offs, potential trends across time, and seeing if there is anything that can predict the likelihood of a Stanley Cup victory!

Doors closing… Welcome to the Blue Line.

So you are watching your favorite NHL team and they finally draw a powerplay. Awesome! The ice opens up with the missing player and it shouldn't be too hard to score...right? As a previous water polo player, I know what it is like to endure the wrath of a furious coach after a missed man advantage opportunity. In my experience, coaches semed convinced that the man-up should lead to a goal 100% of the time. But how important is this seemingly advantageous situation in the NHL?...
