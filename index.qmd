<h2><i class="fas fa-user-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> About Me</h2>

I'm a cognitive neuroscientist doing a (second) postdoc at 23andMe researching genotypic and phenotypic markers of Parkinson's Disease. In my first postdoc, I studied how individuals' sensitivity across multiple sensory modalities predicted their long-term pelvic pain. In graduate school, I studied volitional control of semantic processing, executive dysfunction in chronic-phase traumatic brain injury, and human reasoning. My undergraduate work utilized EEG to understand the neural correlates and timecourse of analogical reasoning. In my spare time I enjoy reading, exercising, crossword puzzles, and the endless pursuit of new hobbies.
